# NV 3070 Test Results and Analysis
## 1. L2 byte mask findings from Nsight compute (l2_byte_mask_test.cu):
   
   ### L1 
   
   receives 131 sectors/131 reqs of global store but have 103 sector misses to L2. meaning L1 could temporarily store the data for a while, even we write 4 bytes each time.
   
   ### L2
   
      * Loadï¼š 98 sectors/98 requests with 1.02% hit rate   
      * Store: 103 sectors/100 requests with 100% hit rate


### Summary

Looks like L1 has write combine feature; L2 has byte mask enabled for every cacheline stored.

### Questions of original code

   * Q1: exec mask for shared TPC/diff TPC/shared SM  is tied to chips, but this may not be correct. Need to figure out thread block distributions

   * Q2: kcicache_interfer kernel. intention of this kernel is to do constatn load plus many dependent ALU ops, which need a lot of instructions to I-cache. However, by checking SASS, I think the compiler optimizes out the ALU ops, which means the kernel intention is not met.

   * Q3: kcbw_8t kernel. I think testing bandwidth should do coalescing access, but each thread is 64 arr ele apart, which means 256byte. not quite sure the reason behind it.

### Results

   * latency: 14 clks (constant cache hit) and 78clks (constant cache miss)
   
   * i-cache interfere:  mask 0x41 -> smid 0 and smid 12 -> latency 238 clks  (Q: not sure how the block is distributed and what is the SMID mapping) 
   
          ans to Q2: the original kernel only has 700 instructions (and my guess is correct.) Need to change the abs to some other arithmetic operations, so we can get large kernel code. I created a kernel code with 37000 instructions, which is ~290KB.    ~19KB;  

          After graduately increasing the kernel size, I found that:  3018 inst(~24KB) -> 78 clk; 4649 inst(~37KB) ->81 clks; (latency keep increasing with increasing # of insts and till) -> 7596 insts(~60KB) -> 238 clks;
          *Need to further analyze the reason behind this

   * bandwidth: need to figure out the right way to get bandwidth
